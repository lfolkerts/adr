Running the program

This program can be run with the following commands:
-./arp_3650  			|to be run on multiple machines
./tour_3650    			|to be run on all machines except the one you start on
./tour_3650 vm10 vm2 vm3 ...	|arguments provided are samples. To be executed on the starting node

IMPORTANT
Note the working arp module has not been fully integrated into our code. The arp_test folder contains working code and a testbench for the arp module.

There are a lot of files available with code. They are broken down as follows 


Makefile		|"make" to make module files; "make test" to generate all files, including test files
-arp		.c .h	|arp communication module. Depreciated.
-arpcache	.c .h	|contains the arpcache structures and functions. Depreciated.
-arp_mod	.c	|the arp main module. Currently an empty shell. Real arp module resides in arp_test/ and is not integrated in.
domainsock	.c .h 	|code to use all AF_LOCAL sockets
hw_addrs	.c .h	|code for retrieving and manipulating hardware addresses
in_cksum	.h	|checksum function, retrieved from http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~benso/redes601/2004_2/in_cksum.c
mcast		.c .h	|multicast function
minix		.c .h	|code for minix vm info
myping		.c .h 	|code for using the ping socket
params		.h	|some code parameters used in the code
rt		.c .h	|code for using the route socke
tour		.c	|main code for the tour module	

Functionality
The code functions as described in the assignment, minus the arp module
The arp module was still having problems into late and we did not have time to integrate it into our code. It resides in arp_test file.
